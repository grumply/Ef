# Ef
The Ef programming language

Ef is a multi-paradigm general-purpose programming language. It's built entirely in Haskell and is, at its core, a pure functional language. Using structural subtyping, Ef pairs immutable objects with an imperative-like monad of K-expressions. Ef recovers an object's world line through immutability and enables method invocation or object messaging via an approach called Patterns (K-expressions, continuation expressions).  Patterns allow for complex interaction with objects; send a Pattern of methods to an object by way of a, possibly complex and dynamic, composition of messages guaranteed statically to be invokable by that object. Ef has a unique approach to object-oriented programming. Composed methods, or messages, look, themselves, like programs; thus, one might call this style of programming language-oriented or middle-out. Objects define the language they implement and inherit the language of their parents. The duality, or symmetry, between K-expressions and their invocation witness is explicit, rather than implicit as method invocation is in most languages. Performance is quite reasonable and the language is fully compatible with all Haskell libraries, even monad transformers!
